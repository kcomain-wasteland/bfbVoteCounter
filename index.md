# BFB Vote Counter
Hello! I don't know why you have stumbled upon here but welcome anyways!
This script is a simple YouTube comment scraper and I don't know why I have made this 
so complex. Anyways, this is the site branch. You will not be able to find the code here. 
You can find it [here](https://github.com/kcomain/bfbVoteCounter) though. Happy counting!

Oh also, I removed the ability of people using the default provided token so :P get your own 
token, it's easy.
