# BFB Vote Counter
Hello! I don't know why you have stumbled upon here but welcome anyways!
This script is a simple YouTube comment scraper and I don't know why I have made this 
so complex. Anyways, this is the site branch. You will not be able to find the code here. 
You can find it [here](https://github.com/kcomain/bfbVoteCounter) though. Happy counting!

Oh also, I removed the ability of people using the default provided token so :P 
Get your own token, it's easy. Just follow the [guide here.](https://github.com/kcomain/bfbVoteCounter/wiki/Getting-your-Google-API-token)
(some note about that in the source code if you want to read them)
<!-- Author's note:
I'm willing to give users access without giving them access to my token but there's a catch - oh wait not *a* catch but a few:
A: If I am going to give access to users without them having to get a token:
a1. I just cannot and if i can: i cannot figure out a good way to lock it out, i can very well put it on a server and lock it out with passwords and stuff but some people is going to figure out how to get in anyways and 
a2. i don't fucking know how to perform checks on clients and at this point seems pointless
B: If i am *not* going to give access to people to my token and they have to use their own
b1. less user friendly
b2. less people using this (no one is using this :))

The likelihood of this counter to be used is slim anyways, so you should checkout the one made by figgyc instead: https://bfb.figgyc.uk
