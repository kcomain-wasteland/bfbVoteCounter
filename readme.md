# BFB Votes Collector
Idea came from when I decided to go on HTC and saw people asking to count votes, I tried to help but ended up using sequencer's code instead.

I wanted to do something in order to take a break from the [Waterbot](https://github.com/waterbotdev/waterbot) project that me and some other 
developers have been doing(P.S. its really cool, you should check it out. Swearing warning from me who's frustrated, and some commands.)

I decided to do this in a different fashion than what sequencer did which allows the counter to count all votes, 
such as the "Loved" character counts, etc.

You may also notice this thing is not written in javascript but instead in python because...thats the only language I know quite fluently besides scratch :^)

## Setting up
To setup the vote collector, you only need to follow a few steps.

(If you're a pro gamer and know how to use git just clone the repo locally and cd to it and skup till step #.)

1. Download the code. Click the "Clone or Download button". (![Clone or Download button](https://kenny-pls.go-get-a.life/fbFxBO.png))

2. Press the ``Download ZIP`` button. (![Download ZIP Button](https://kenny-pls.go-get-a.life/lXDvJn.png))
Save it to any directory you like. If your antivirus told you it's a virus please dismiss it. This code is not and will not be a virus. 
All it does is just download the comments from Google's servers and process it in a fancy manner so you can see which character got how many votes. 
You can see the VirusTotal scan result for the bare python code once it is finished.

3. Uncompress the zip file. If you're on Windows and uses WinRAR, open it, right click on the ``bfbVoteCounter-master`` folder and use any of these 
options. ![Options](https://kenny-pls.go-get-a.life/TIrIyk.png)
