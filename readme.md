# BFB Votes Collector
Idea came from when I decided to go on HTC and saw people asking to count votes, I tried to help but ended up using sequencer's code instead.

I wanted to do something in order to take a break from the [Waterbot](https://github.com/waterbotdev/waterbot) project that me and some other 
developers have been doing(P.S. its really cool, you should check it out. Swearing warning from me who's frustrated, and some commands.)

I decided to do this in a different fashion than what sequencer did which allows the counter to count all votes, 
such as the "Loved" character counts, etc.

You may also notice this thing is not written in javascript but instead in python because...thats the only language I know quite fluently besides scratch :^)
